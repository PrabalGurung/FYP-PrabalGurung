Week4

Database extraction pressing a button updates and at start loads database

Functional and nonfunctional requirement

do i have to make new object if i change the scene 
changing scene destroys all objects except static value and using the method of unity DontDestroyObjectOnLoad

Clear problem week 2-4  --

Not loading properly
data continuously not loaded (need to call method everytime?)

problem
database not updated properly (have to use button)


Week 5

dfd level 0 and 1

value stacking properly using update method instead of insert command in SQLite making it easier to read

Object stack 
using the method of unity makes stack of the same gameobject as the old one is not destroyed

having harder time to extract data from database created gameobject for every database item extraction
inventory item shown properly after gameobject was made during calling of item in database

in inventory page (topdown view), red color is shown in the item slot where item are captured

items are extracted from the database which are either picked in overworld or got from inventory

in inventory page item panel, there are multiple slots where player items are shown, on clicking (slot are made as button) details are shown in detail panel

problem
item can be picked in overworld but it wont disappear after picked 

tasks 

inventory item show  --
inventory extraction from database  --
hovering or clicking on item should show its details --
item in overworld mechanics --

slot that is not the part of item is shown error

slot are deleted making no slot to be shown after scene change

Week6
use case diagram
dfd level 2

Player Movement Problem
Disabling gameobject at the start stops player movement so it should be kept enabled.

Due to the start() function it wont make slot again making it impossible to excess it again.
made the game object dont destroy on load and made in game ui inexcessible during turn base battle 

in turn base battle when extracting item from database shows extra blank slot
to remove extra blank slot extra condition added where i > 0


Week 7
made item usable in turn base battle based on which inventory item is selected yet to decrease to number and if 0 or null delete the item.

in turn base battle it will continuously update inventory item but there is a error nullpoint reference error

items are usable (turn base only made)
Item Should be usable in turn base battle --

Interaction with house --
Player is able to interact with the house in T1 and will be transported to H1 

multiple npc cannot talk only the latest one is able to talk
most likely because object has been overwritten with the latest one (put in array???s)
put an array and check which character is nearest to player using vector3 player.position and return the nearest npc that way object wont be replace by hiarchy and change according
npc closest to player

fixed the problem where character will always face down       

fixed the problem where item could be taken infinite number of time and item would not destroy unless you are far from the item
